# Gauss sketch book
Gauss sketch book contains generalized implementation of Difference of Gaussians or DoG in short.

Featured Filters:
- DoG
- XDoG
- FDoG (‚ö† WIP)

## Features
- `presentation.mlx` matlab live script where the implementation of the methods are explained step by step.
- ü¶ÄRust library of mentioned filters. used for static image filtering and realtime filtering.
- üêçPython binding of the rust.

## Installs
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for `presentation.mlx`.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for using the rust library.
- [Python](https://www.python.org) for using the python library.

## Examples
Raw image on the right and Filtered image on the left.
### XDoG
`œÉ = 1.4 | Œµ = 0.6 | p = 1.0 | œÜ = 6.0`

## How to Use
### `presentation.mlx`
Open the file in MATLAB and run the script.

**Note:** the script depends on the `assets/images` and `assets/textures` folder.

### `Rust`
‚ö† work in progress

### `Python`
‚ö† work in progress
